Summary of JavaScript Switch Statements
=======================================

This document explains the use of `switch` statements in JavaScript as an alternative to chained `if`/`else if` statements for handling multiple conditions. It provides an example of an `if`/`else if` chain that checks the value of a variable `dayofWk` and triggers alerts for "Sat", "Sun", or "Fri". The document then details the structure of a `switch` statement, focusing on its initial components:

1.  **Switch Keyword**: The statement starts with `switch`, followed by the variable to test (e.g., `dayofWk`) in parentheses, and an opening curly brace `{`.
2.  **Case Clause**: Each condition begins with the `case` keyword, followed by a value (e.g., `"Sat"`), a colon (`:`), and a space.
3.  **Executable Statements**: If the variable matches the `case` value, indented statements execute. Multiple statements can be included for each case.

This structure allows for efficient handling of multiple conditions based on a single variable's value.
