Summary of JavaScript Commenting
================================

This document outlines the role and syntax of comments in JavaScript:

1.  **Purpose of Comments**: Comments explain code for human readers, not for browser execution. They enhance code clarity, assist in revisions, and allow disabling code for testing or debugging.
2.  **Importance in JavaScript**: Due to JavaScript's complexity compared to HTML or CSS, thorough commenting is essential, especially for team projects or future maintenance by others.
3.  **Comment Syntax in JavaScript**:
    -   **Single-line Comments**: Start with `//` to comment out a single line (e.g., `// This is a comment. Ignored by the browser`).
    -   **Multi-line Comments**: Enclosed between `/*` and `*/` to comment out multiple lines.
4.  **Comparison with HTML and CSS**: HTML uses `<!-- -->` and CSS uses `/* */` for comments, while JavaScript supports both `//` for single lines and `/* */` for multiple lines.
