JavaScript Functions Assignment
===============================

This project contains solutions to a series of JavaScript exercises focused on creating functions for common tasks, including array manipulation, string processing, and basic computations. The exercises are implemented in a web application using HTML and JavaScript.

Project Structure
-----------------

-   **index.html**: The main HTML file that provides the structure for the web page and links to the JavaScript file.
-   **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code implementing all 6 function exercises.
-   **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

Exercises Overview
------------------

The following exercises demonstrate proficiency in writing JavaScript functions, handling arrays, strings, and DOM manipulation. Each solution is implemented in the `script.js` file and outputs results to the browser.

1.  **Sum of Array**: A function that takes an array of numbers and returns their sum using a loop or `reduce()`.
2.  **Reverse String**: A function that reverses a string (e.g., "hello" → "olleh") using string methods or iteration.
3.  **Largest Number in Array**: A function that finds the largest number in an array using comparison or `Math.max()`.
4.  **Count Vowels**: A function that counts vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a string, case-insensitive, using a loop or regex.
5.  **Remove Duplicates**: A function that removes duplicates from an array, preserving unique elements, using `Set` or iteration.
6.  **Capitalize First Letters**: A function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence (e.g., "hello world" → "Hello World").

Setup Instructions
------------------

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository**:

    -   Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2.  **Open the Project**:

    -   Open `index.html` in a web browser to run the application.
    -   The JavaScript code in `script.js` will execute automatically, prompting the user for inputs or displaying results in the browser.
3.  **Dependencies**:

    -   No external libraries are required. The project uses vanilla JavaScript and runs in any modern web browser.

Usage
-----

-   Open `index.html` in a browser.
-   Follow any prompt dialogs (if implemented) to provide inputs for testing the functions.
-   Results will be displayed in the browser using `document.write()`, `console.log()`, or alerts, depending on the implementation.
-   To test specific functions, you can comment/uncomment sections in `script.js` or modify the code to focus on individual solutions.

Notes
-----

-   The solutions are designed to be simple and educational, focusing on function creation and basic JavaScript concepts.
-   Outputs are displayed using `document.write()` or similar methods for simplicity. In a production environment, consider using DOM manipulation for a better user experience.
-   Ensure pop-up blockers are disabled if prompts are used for input.
-   Functions are designed to handle edge cases (e.g., empty arrays, empty strings) where applicable.
