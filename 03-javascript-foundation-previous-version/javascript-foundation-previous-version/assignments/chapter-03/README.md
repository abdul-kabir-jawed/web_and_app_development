JavaScript Variables for Numbers - Chapter 3 Exercises
======================================================

This project contains a JavaScript script that demonstrates the use of variables for numbers as part of Chapter 2 exercises. The script performs the following tasks:

Features
--------

1.  **Display Age in Alert Box**\
    Declares a variable `age`, assigns it a value representing the user's age, and displays it in an alert box.

2.  **Track and Display Website Visits**\
    Declares and initializes a variable to track the number of times a visitor has visited the webpage, displaying a message like: "You have visited this site N times."

3.  **Display Birth Year**\
    Declares a variable `birthYear`, assigns it the user's birth year, and shows a message in the browser.

4.  **Online Clothing Store Order**\
    Stores information about a visitor's order on an online clothing store (`www.xyzClothing.com`), including:

    -   Visitor's name
    -   Product title
    -   Quantity of products ordered\
        Displays a message in the browser, e.g., "John Doe ordered 5 T-shirt(s) on XYZ Clothing store."



Technologies Used
-----------------

-   HTML
-   JavaScript

Notes
-----

-   The visit counter uses `localStorage` to persist the number of visits across page reloads.
-   Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser to view the outputs.
-   The messages are displayed using `alert` and `document.write` for simplicity, as per the exercise requirements.
