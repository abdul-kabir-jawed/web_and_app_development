JavaScript Math Expressions
===========================

This repository contains JavaScript solutions for the **Math Expressions** chapter, covering fundamental arithmetic operations, variable manipulations, and practical applications like calculators and converters. Each task is implemented in a single HTML file with embedded JavaScript, designed to display results in the browser.

Overview
--------

This project addresses a series of exercises focused on JavaScript mathematical expressions, including:

-   Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus).
-   Variable declarations and manipulations (increments, decrements, and arithmetic sequences).
-   Practical applications like currency conversion, temperature conversion, shopping cart checkout, and geometric calculations.
-   Output is displayed in the browser using `document.write()` for simplicity.

Tasks
-----

Below is a summary of the tasks implemented in the `index.html` file:

1.  **Basic Arithmetic**: Add two numbers and display the result in the browser.
2.  **Extended Arithmetic**: Perform subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus on two numbers.
3.  **Variable Manipulation**:
    -   Declare a variable, display its initial value, increment it, add 7, decrement it, and show the remainder when divided by 3.
4.  **Movie Ticket Cost**: Calculate the cost of buying 5 movie tickets (600 PKR each).
5.  **Multiplication Table**: Display the multiplication table of a given number.
6.  **Temperature Converter**: Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
7.  **Shopping Cart Checkout**: Compute the total cost of items in a shopping cart, including shipping charges.
8.  **Percentage Calculator**: Calculate a student's percentage based on total and obtained marks.
9.  **Currency Conversion**: Convert US dollars and Saudi Riyals to Pakistani Rupees in a single expression.
10. **Arithmetic Sequence**: Perform a sequence of operations (add 5, multiply by 10, divide by 2) in a single expression.
11. **Age Calculator**: Calculate two possible ages based on the current year and birth year.
12. **Geometrizer**: Calculate the circumference and area of a circle given its radius.
13. **Lifetime Supply Calculator**: Estimate the total amount of a favorite snack needed for a lifetime.

How to Run
----------

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3.  The results of all tasks will be displayed in the browser.
4.  Optionally, inspect the console (F12 > Console) for additional output or debugging.
