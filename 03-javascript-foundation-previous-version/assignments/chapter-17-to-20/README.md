JavaScript Arrays and Loops Assignment
======================================

This project contains solutions to a series of JavaScript exercises focusing on arrays and loops, as part of the curriculum for learning JavaScript (Chapters 17-20). The solutions are implemented in a `script.js` file and displayed in a simple web page via `index.html`.

Project Structure
-----------------

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
-   `script.js`: Contains all the JavaScript code for the exercises.
-   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and documentation of the project.

Exercises Overview
------------------

The following exercises demonstrate the use of arrays, multidimensional arrays, loops, and user input handling in JavaScript. Each solution outputs results to the browser console or via DOM manipulation.

1.  **Empty Multidimensional Array**: Declares and initializes an empty multidimensional array (array of arrays).
2.  **Matrix Representation**: Declares and initializes a multidimensional array representing a matrix.
3.  **Numeric Counting**: Prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.
4.  **Multiplication Table**: Generates a multiplication table for a user-specified number and length using a for loop.
5.  **Array Iteration**: Prints items of an array (`fruits`) using a for loop.
6.  **Series Generation**:
    -   Counting: 1 to 15
    -   Reverse Counting: 10 to 1
    -   Even Numbers: 0 to 20
    -   Odd Numbers: 1 to 19
    -   Series: 2k to 20k
7.  **Array Search**: Enables searching for an item in an array (`A`) based on user input, with feedback on whether the item is found.
8.  **Largest Number**: Identifies the largest number in a given array.

Setup Instructions
------------------

1.  Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2.  Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the output of the exercises.
3.  Open the browser's developer tools (Console) to see the results of the JavaScript code.
4.  For interactive exercises (e.g., multiplication table, array search), use the browser's prompt dialogs to input data.

Usage
-----

-   The `script.js` file contains all the logic for the exercises. Each exercise is clearly commented for easy identification.
-   Outputs are displayed either in the console or appended to the DOM in `index.html`.
-   For exercises requiring user input, the browser will prompt for values when the page loads.

Technologies Used
-----------------

-   **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the web page.
-   **JavaScript (ES6)**: For implementing the logic of arrays and loops.

Notes
-----

-   Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser to run the scripts.
-   Some exercises use `prompt()` for simplicity, but in a production environment, consider using HTML forms for better user interaction.
-   The matrix in Exercise 2 is assumed to be a 3x3 matrix with sample values (e.g., `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`) as the original question did not specify values.
