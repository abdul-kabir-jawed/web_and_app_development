JavaScript String Methods Assignment
This project contains solutions to a series of JavaScript exercises focused on string manipulation, as outlined in Chapters 20 to 25 of the curriculum. The exercises cover various string methods and user input handling, implemented in a web application using HTML and JavaScript.
Project Structure

index.html: The main HTML file that provides the structure for the web page and links to the JavaScript file.
script.js: Contains the JavaScript code implementing all 18 string method exercises.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

Exercises Overview
The following exercises demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript string methods, user input handling, and DOM manipulation. Each solution is implemented in the script.js file and outputs results to the browser.

Full Name Greeting: Takes first and last name inputs via prompt, merges them into fullName, and displays a greeting.
Mobile Phone Model Length: Takes a favorite mobile phone model as input and displays its length.
Index of 'n' in "Pakistani": Finds and displays the index of the letter "n" in "Pakistani".
Last Index of 'l' in "Hello World": Finds and displays the last index of the letter "l" in "Hello World".
Character at 3rd Index in "Pakistani": Displays the character at the 3rd index of "Pakistani".
Full Name with concat(): Repeats exercise 1 using the concat() method to merge names.
Replace "Hyder" with "Islam": Replaces "Hyder" with "Islam" in "Hyderabad" and displays the result.
Replace All "and" with "&": Replaces all occurrences of "and" with "&" in a given sentence.
String to Number Conversion: Converts the string "472" to a number and displays its value and type.
Convert to Capital Letters: Takes user input and converts it to uppercase.
Convert to Title Case: Takes user input and converts it to title case.
Number to String without Dot: Converts the number 35.36 to a string and removes the dot to display "3536".
Validate Username: Checks if a username contains special symbols (@, ., ,, !) and prompts for a valid username if needed.
Array Search: Searches for a user-entered item in an array of food items, performing a case-insensitive search.
Password Validation: Validates a password to ensure it contains alphabets and numbers, doesnâ€™t start with a number, and is at least 6 characters long.
String to Array: Converts the string "University of Karachi" to an array using split() and displays the elements.
Last Character of Input: Displays the last character of a user-entered string.
Count "the" in String: Counts the occurrences of the word "the" in the string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".

Setup Instructions

Clone or Download the Repository:

Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.


Open the Project:

Open index.html in a web browser to run the application.
The JavaScript code in script.js will execute automatically, prompting the user for inputs and displaying results in the browser.


Dependencies:

No external libraries are required. The project uses vanilla JavaScript and runs in any modern web browser.



Usage

Open index.html in a browser.
Follow the prompt dialogs to provide inputs for each exercise.
Results will be displayed in the browser using document.write() or alerts, as specified in each exercise.
To view specific exercise outputs, you can comment/uncomment sections in script.js or modify the code to focus on individual solutions.

Notes

The solutions are designed to be simple and educational, focusing on string methods and basic JavaScript concepts.
Outputs are displayed using document.write() for simplicity, as per the assignment requirements. In a production environment, consider using DOM manipulation for better user experience.
Ensure pop-up blockers are disabled in the browser to allow prompt dialogs.
The code assumes ASCII character codes for validation (e.g., ! = 33, , = 44, . = 46, @ = 64) as specified.
