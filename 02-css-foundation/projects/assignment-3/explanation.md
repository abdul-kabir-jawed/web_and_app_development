## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### HTML Foundation

#### Semantic Structure
Each page should follow proper HTML5 semantic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- Meta information, title, links to CSS and fonts -->
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <!-- Site title and main navigation -->
    </header>
    <main>
        <!-- Page-specific content -->
    </main>
    <footer>
        <!-- Copyright, additional links -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Navigation Implementation
The navigation should be consistent across all pages, using:
- `<nav>` element for semantic meaning
- `<ul>` and `<li>` for the menu structure
- Clear, descriptive link text
- Active page indication using CSS classes

### CSS Architecture

#### Font Management Strategy
Each page uses a different primary font to create distinct atmospheres:

1. **Home Page - Playfair Display**
   - Why: Elegant, sophisticated serif that creates a welcoming literary atmosphere
   - Usage: Headers and important text
   - Fallback: serif

2. **Nature Poems - Merriweather**
   - Why: Highly readable serif designed for screens, evokes traditional literature
   - Usage: All text for comfortable reading
   - Fallback: Georgia, serif

3. **Love Poems - Dancing Script**
   - Why: Romantic, handwritten feel that matches emotional content
   - Usage: Headers and accent text (body text should use readable font)
   - Fallback: cursive

4. **Melancholy Poems - Crimson Text**
   - Why: Sophisticated serif with serious, contemplative character
   - Usage: Creates thoughtful, literary atmosphere
   - Fallback: Times New Roman, serif

5. **Inspirational Poems - Montserrat**
   - Why: Modern, clean sans-serif that feels energetic and forward-looking
   - Usage: Creates dynamic, contemporary feel
   - Fallback: Arial, sans-serif

#### Color Psychology Application

**Home Page (Purple & Gold)**
- Purple: Creativity, wisdom, luxury, mystery
- Gold: Warmth, success, achievement
- Effect: Creates sophisticated, welcoming entrance

**Nature Poems (Earth Tones)**
- Greens: Growth, harmony, nature, tranquility
- Browns: Stability, reliability, earthiness
- Sky Blue: Peace, serenity, openness
- Effect: Connects readers with natural world

**Love Poems (Rose & Pink Tones)**
- Rose: Romance, love, gentleness
- Pink: Affection, warmth, nurturing
- Cream: Softness, comfort, elegance
- Effect: Creates intimate, romantic atmosphere

**Melancholy Poems (Muted Blues & Grays)**
- Blue: Contemplation, sadness, depth
- Gray: Neutrality, balance, sophistication
- Dark tones: Introspection, seriousness
- Effect: Supports reflective, thoughtful mood

**Inspirational Poems (Bright, Energetic Colors)**
- Orange: Enthusiasm, creativity, energy
- Yellow: Optimism, happiness, enlightenment
- Bright Blue: Confidence, trust, reliability
- Effect: Energizes and motivates readers

## üé® Design Principles

### Typography Best Practices

#### Hierarchy and Readability
- **Primary Headers (h1)**: 2.5-3rem, using page-specific font
- **Secondary Headers (h2)**: 2-2.5rem, maintaining visual hierarchy
- **Body Text**: 1.1-1.2rem, always prioritizing readability
- **Line Height**: 1.5-1.6 for optimal reading comfort
- **Paragraph Spacing**: 1.5rem between paragraphs
