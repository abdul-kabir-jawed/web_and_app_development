# Stairs to Success - Assignment 6
## Periodic Table and Chess Board using HTML Tables

### Assignment Overview
This is the seventh assignment in the "Stairs to Success" series. The objective is to create both a periodic table and a chess board using HTML tables without using any CSS styling.

### Assignment Requirements
1. **Create a Periodic Table** - Build a representation of the periodic table of elements using HTML table structure
2. **Create a Chess Board** - Build an 8x8 chess board pattern using HTML table structure
3. **No CSS Allowed** - The entire assignment must be completed using only HTML table elements with no CSS styling whatsoever
4. **Use Table Elements** - Utilize HTML `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>` elements to structure both layouts

### Technical Specifications
- **HTML Only**: Pure HTML implementation without any external stylesheets or inline CSS
- **Table-Based Layout**: Both the periodic table and chess board must use HTML table structure
- **Semantic Structure**: Proper use of table headers (`<th>`) and data cells (`<td>`)
- **Accessibility**: Use of appropriate table attributes for better structure

### File Structure
```
assignment-6/
├── README.md
├── index.html (main file containing both periodic table and chess board)
└── (no CSS files as per requirements)
```

### Features Implemented

#### Periodic Table
- Complete representation of the first 18 elements
- Organized by periods (rows) and groups (columns)
- Element symbols and atomic numbers included
- Proper table structure with headers for group numbers
- Empty cells for non-existent elements in early periods

#### Chess Board
- Standard 8x8 chess board layout
- Alternating pattern using HTML table cells
- Row and column labels (A-H, 1-8)
- Proper table structure for board representation

### How to View
1. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser
2. The page will display both the periodic table and chess board
3. No additional setup or dependencies required

### Learning Objectives
- Understanding HTML table structure and semantics
- Creating complex layouts using only table elements
- Working within constraints (no CSS)
- Building structured data representations
- Understanding the relationship between HTML elements and visual layout

### Technical Challenges Addressed
- Creating visual patterns without CSS styling
- Organizing complex data (periodic table) in tabular format
- Implementing alternating patterns (chess board) using only HTML
- Maintaining semantic structure while achieving visual goals

### Assignment Completion
This assignment demonstrates proficiency in:
- HTML table creation and manipulation
- Structural HTML without relying on CSS
- Understanding of tabular data presentation
- Problem-solving within technical constraints

### Notes
- All styling effects are achieved through HTML attributes only
- The design prioritizes functionality and structure over visual aesthetics
- Code is written to be clean, readable, and semantically correct
- Both components are contained within a single HTML file for simplicity
